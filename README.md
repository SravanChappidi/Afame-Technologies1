## HR data Analysis

1. **Project Overview**:
   ** Cleanse and standardize HR data to improve data quality and integrity.
   ** Identify and resolve data inconsistencies, duplicates, missing values, and outliers.
   ** Enhance data accuracy and reliability for effective HR data analysis and decision-making.
   ** Prepare cleansed data for advanced analytics, visualization, and reporting.
   ** Document data cleansing processes and best practices for future reference and replication.

2. **Data Sources**:
   -  Raw  HR Data Analysis Excel file.

3. **Data Cleaning Process**:
   - The data cleansing process includes:
   - Data Profiling: Analyzing the structure, content, and quality of HR datasets.
   - Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting data anomalies, such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Standardization: Ensuring uniformity and consistency in data formats, codes, and categories.
   - Validation: Performing data quality checks and validation tests to verify data accuracy and completeness.
   - Data Transformation: Preparing cleansed data for analysis by transforming and organizing it into usable formats.
   - Documentation: Documenting data cleansing procedures, transformations, and validations for transparency and reproducibility.

4. **Excel Functions and Formulas**:
   - Data Validation:Sets criteria for valid data entry in cells using Excel's data validation feature.
    Example:Restricting data entry in a cell to a specified list or range of values.
   - Conditional Formatting:Applies formatting (such as color changes) based on specified conditions, helping to visually identify data anomalies.
    Example: Highlighting cells with values greater than a certain threshold.
   - ISBLANK and IFERROR Functions
     Checks if a cell is blank or handles errors in formulas, respectively.
     Example: =IFERROR(A2/B2, "Error") calculates A2 divided by B2 and returns "Error" if there's a calculation error.
5. **Data Quality Checks**:
   - Completeness Check:
   - Consistency Check:
   - Accuracy Check:
   - Validity Check:
   - Duplication Check:
   - Integrity Check:
   - Timeliness Check:
   - Outlier Detection:
   - Data Profiling:
   - Cross-Validation:
   - Error Handling:

 6. **Tools and Technologies**:
   - Used the Excel version or tools used for data cleaning and analysis ( Excel 365, Excel Macros).
